# Canonical analytics architecture: current state

**Evidence freeze:** 2026-07-20
**Repository baseline:** `utekos-brand/utekos-headless` at `16296b58fdad3713814b776028e74758ac2f3686`
**Production deployment:** `dpl_8mmJZonfNHBXc3ugyLyHYxrULRrv`, READY, `arn1`, Node.js 24.x
**Branch:** `docs/analytics-current-state`

## Documentation status

The repository, live Supabase warehouse, Vercel project, production logs, first-party GTM/sGTM endpoints and published web-container payload were inspected read-only. GTM Admin API, GA4 Admin/Data API, Meta Events Manager, Microsoft Ads/UET and Shopify Admin webhook delivery/subscription views were unavailable or unauthorized. Claims requiring those surfaces are marked **blocked**, not inferred.

Status vocabulary:

- **Verified:** direct source plus runtime/database corroboration, or two independent primary sources.
- **Observed:** one current primary source.
- **Unknown:** evidence does not decide the question.
- **Blocked:** the required system exists, but current authorization/tooling cannot read it.
- **Refuted:** current primary evidence contradicts the prior claim.

## Executive summary

The project already has a substantial canonical architecture. It has a typed event catalog, a shared consent-aware browser collector, 23 first-party event routes, Zod validation, atomic ledger/outbox persistence, a generic `SKIP LOCKED` outbox, 24 Google and 8 Meta workers, provider retries/dead letters, Google request-status reconciliation, Shopify-owned purchase/refund events, Cookiebot Consent Mode and first-party GTM/sGTM routing.

The principal problem is not absence of a canonical pipeline. It is coexistence with historical naming/data, overly broad immediate dispatch, generic acceptance semantics and incomplete provider/runtime verification. A successful browser request schedules all registered provider-event workers, each with `maxItems: 1`; it can therefore claim unrelated backlog and compete with the five-minute cron. The live warehouse has 19,043 ledger rows and 21,588 attempts, no active backlog and no duplicate canonical IDs, but contains both canonical snake_case and legacy/provider PascalCase names. Google finality is reconciled; generic Meta success is still persisted as `accepted_unverified`. Microsoft browser UET is present; purchase UET CAPI is reintroduced in-repo (production smoke pending).

## System boundaries

```text
Shopify storefront and webhooks
  -> Next.js 16.2 App Router on Vercel
  -> first-party event APIs
  -> Supabase PostgreSQL canonical ledger and provider outbox
  -> Google Data Manager / Meta CAPI workers

Browser
  -> dataLayer / web GTM
  -> first-party /__gtg loader
  -> first-party /__sgtm server tagging endpoint
  -> GA4 / Meta browser / Microsoft UET according to GTM and consent
```

Klarna Search & Compare is a commerce/feed experiment, not a registered canonical event provider. PostHog is catalogued but the storefront integration is currently not implemented.

## Repository and production freeze

| Local pre-existing changes | `.mcp.json`, `PLAN.md`, `config/mcp/servers.base.json` | Initial `git status`; excluded from this commit |

PR 44 adds a ten-identifier cap and positive retry jitter to pre-refactor files. The same intent is already on `main`: `googleDataManagerSharedMapping.ts` centralizes `MAX_USER_IDENTIFIERS = 10`, deduplication and interleaving, while `processProviderOutboxAttempt.ts` applies positive jitter. Merging PR 44 would reintroduce event-specific mapping structure. It should be closed as superseded only after separate approval; Oppgave 0 did not change it.

## Canonical event model

`src/lib/analytics/eventCatalog.ts` declares 29 events: 25 active and four `blocked_source`. `src/lib/analytics/canonicalEvent.ts` defines the implemented Zod discriminated union. Each active event declares an owner, trigger, dedupe policy, consent policy and provider mapping. The complete chain is in [event-matrix.md](event-matrix.md).

The four source-blocked events are:

- `add_shipping_info`
- `add_payment_info`
- `checkout_error`
- `payment_error`

They are not eligible for persistence or provider dispatch until an authoritative source is implemented.

### Event creation

- Browser reporters create UUID `event_id` values and ISO-offset `event_time` values.
- `page_view` uses a per-navigation `page_view_id`; a committed navigation is emitted once by `pageViewSession.ts`.
- Mutation events use an authoritative mutation/interaction identifier.
- Shopify `purchase` and `refund` use deterministic UUIDs derived from the order/refund identifiers, preserving retry idempotency.
- Ledger idempotency is `event_name:event_id`; provider idempotency is provider plus the canonical key.

### Browser collection and dataLayer

Most active browser events follow this shared pattern:

1. An event-specific reporter builds and validates the canonical payload.
2. The reporter emits a canonical snake_case dataLayer event through `sendGTMEvent`.
3. A thin event-specific collector transport delegates to `createCanonicalCollectorTransport`.
4. The collector waits for Cookiebot when no authoritative response exists.
5. It strips consent-ineligible identifiers and sends JSON to `/api/events/<event>`.
6. It retries one network/408/429/5xx failure once, then reports failure to Sentry.

The event-specific `*CollectorTransport.ts` files are thin endpoint/name/type wrappers. Reporter files are necessary specialization because they map UI-specific inputs and own dataLayer emission. `pageViewCollectorTransport.ts` and `viewItemCollectorTransport.ts` contain additional enrichment/dedupe behavior and are not mere aliases. No compatibility alias was proven unused; deletion requires call-site analysis in a later task.

### URL, referrer and request context

- Page/referrer URLs are normalized as absolute HTTP(S) URLs.
- Google mapping removes fragments, then query strings if required, and truncates to provider limits.
- Browser event schemas never accept an arbitrary client-provided IP/user agent as trusted server context.
- Server request context derives IP/user agent from headers and applies provider restrictions.

## Consent and identity

Cookiebot is the CMP. The published web container contains `uc.js` and `implementation=gtm`; the app does not load `uc.js` itself. The application defines default-denied Consent Mode v2 before tag use:

- `ad_storage`, `ad_user_data`, `ad_personalization`, `analytics_storage`, `functionality_storage`, `personalization_storage`: denied
- `security_storage`: granted
- `ads_data_redaction`: true
- `url_passthrough`: true
- Microsoft UET `ad_storage`: denied

The shared collector maps Cookiebot statistics to analytics, marketing to marketing and preferences to preferences. Without consent:

- analytics browser IDs are removed unless analytics is granted;
- marketing browser/click IDs, external ID, user data and impression ID are removed unless marketing is granted;
- browser-permission location requires preferences consent;
- IP and user agent are not accepted from the browser payload.

Identity handling:

| Identifier | Source and lifetime | Consent | Recipients/current use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `event_id` | UUID per occurrence; deterministic for Shopify transaction events | Event's collection basis | Ledger, outbox, Meta dedupe, provider mappings |
| `page_view_id` | In-memory UUID per committed navigation | Analytics or marketing | Related browser events |
| `external_id` | `anon_<uuid>` first-party cookie, one year | Marketing | Canonical payload, Meta/approved provider mappings |
| GA `client_id` | `_ga` and Google tag `get` path | Analytics | Google mappings; missing value becomes `skipped_unqualified` |
| `fbp`, `fbc` | Meta cookies | Marketing | Meta matching/dedupe support |
| click IDs | URL, sessionStorage and 90-day localStorage | Marketing | Google/Meta/Microsoft mappings as applicable |
| email/phone | Pre-hashed SHA-256 arrays only | Marketing | Google/Meta mappings; max ten Google identifiers |
| IP/user agent | Server request context | Provider policy and consent | Meta website context; Google device info where allowed |
| postal/country | Customer/server/browser location source | Marketing/preferences according to source | Provider matching where approved |

The durable click-ID store catches storage/privacy failures silently by design. This is a documented best-effort browser persistence behavior, not evidence of provider delivery.

## Validation and API routes

`canonicalEventEnvelopeSchema` is strict and validates schema version, event name, UUID, offset datetime, source/environment, Cookiebot consent, hashed-contact shapes, identifier maps, URLs and optional location/device context. `canonicalEventSchema` dispatches by `event_name`.

There are 23 browser event routes under `src/app/api/events`. Each route delegates collection to the event-specific canonical handler and wires `runRegisteredProviderOutboxBatch` through `after()`. Purchase and refund arrive through Shopify webhook routes; `generate_lead` and `form_submit` are server-owned even though event API routes also exist for their canonical collection path.

Duplicate canonical events return the existing event outcome without inserting new dispatch rows. Live production has 19,043 distinct event IDs and idempotency keys across 19,043 ledger rows.

## Persistence and atomicity

`postgresCanonicalPageViewStore.ts` is misnamed but generic:

- It creates one `postgres` client using `SUPABASE_VERCEL_POSTGRES_URL_NON_POOLING`.
- `sql.begin()` encloses ledger insertion and every provider-attempt insertion.
- Ledger insertion uses `ON CONFLICT (idempotency_key) DO NOTHING`.
- If ledger insertion is duplicate, no dispatch rows are created.
- Provider insertion uses `ON CONFLICT (provider, idempotency_key) DO NOTHING`.
- Any dispatch insertion error rejects the callback and rolls back the ledger insertion.

No database RPC or trigger performs the same acceptance transaction. Direct PostgreSQL transaction code is the sole current implementation. The exported `postgresCanonicalPageViewStore` is only an alias of `postgresCanonicalEventStore`; the file cannot be deleted before the generic implementation is moved/renamed.

Live constraints:

- unique `marketing.event_ledger(idempotency_key)`;
- unique `ops.provider_dispatch_attempts(provider, idempotency_key)`;
- status, dispatch mode, attempt count, HTTP status and latency checks;
- RLS enabled, no policies, no `anon`/`authenticated` grants, no triggers.

## Provider outbox

### Creation

`planCanonicalEventDispatch` reads the active catalog. It creates only active, supported outbox intents for which required consent exists. Google rows without `client_id` are persisted as terminal `skipped_unqualified` with `skip_reason='missing_client_id'`.

### Claim and locking

Each adapter owns a `(provider, event_name)` claimant. The claim query:

- selects `server_retry` rows;
- claims `pending`/`retry_scheduled` rows whose `next_attempt_at` is due;
- reclaims `processing` rows stale for ten minutes;
- orders stale processing first;
- uses `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`;
- atomically updates the row to `processing` and increments `attempt_count`.

### Retry and dead letter

- Max batch size: 100.
- Current adapters use their declared max attempts/delay schedule and positive jitter.
- Retryable errors become `retry_scheduled`.
- Permanent errors or exhausted attempts become `dead_lettered`.
- Dead lettering and insertion into `ops.dead_letter_events` happen in one SQL statement.
- Invalid payloads are dead-lettered without provider dispatch.

### Immediate and cron dispatch

Both `/api/cron/provider-outbox-dispatch` and `/api/cron/google-data-manager-status` run every five minutes. The dispatch cron uses one item per worker. Browser routes and Shopify transaction webhooks also schedule `runRegisteredProviderOutboxBatch({maxItems: 1})` after successful acceptance.

`runRegisteredProviderOutboxBatch` executes every registry entry in `Promise.all`. There are 32 workers: 24 Google and 8 Meta. Thus `maxItems: 1` means one item **per worker**, not one item for the accepted event. This confirms the P0 isolation defect.

### Index alignment

The queue has useful status, provider/status, event/provider, skipped and dead-letter indexes. The main claim key includes provider, event name, dispatch mode, status and due time, but no index includes `event_name`; under backlog, each worker can heap-filter the shared queue. Google status polling has no `request_id` index and currently plans a sequential scan. No index was added in this audit.

## Status and finality

Live allowed statuses:

| Status | Set by | Terminal | Meaning |
|---|---|---:|---|
| `pending` | Persistence plan | No | Eligible for initial claim |
| `processing` | Claim/reclaim query | No | Leased/being processed; reclaim after ten minutes |
| `retry_scheduled` | Generic worker | No | Retryable failure with due time |
| `accepted_unverified` | Generic worker completion | Provider-dependent | Adapter call returned a receipt; finality not proven |
| `succeeded` | Google reconciliation or historical repair | Yes | Provider-confirmed or administratively classified success |
| `failed` | Historical schema state | No current writer found | Legacy/non-current |
| `dead_lettered` | Worker or Google reconciliation | Yes until explicit replay | Permanent/exhausted/invalid/provider-confirmed failure |
| `skipped_unqualified` | Dispatch planning/repair | Yes | Provider prerequisites absent or adapter unavailable |

The worker outcome `succeeded` is always persisted through a method named `markAcceptedUnverified`, so both Google and Meta successful adapter calls first become `accepted_unverified`. Google has a separate reconciler: request IDs are leased and statuses map `SUCCESS` to `succeeded`, `FAILED`/`PARTIAL_SUCCESS` to dead letter, and `PROCESSING`/unknown back to `accepted_unverified`. Meta has no equivalent reconciliation worker in the repository. Generic acceptance therefore overstates neither finality nor provider equality, but the shared name/status is too coarse for operational decisions.

## Provider state

### Google Analytics and GTM

- Active GA4 measurement ID in the published container: `G-FCES3L0M9M`.
- Active Google tag: `GT-MKRLF5WK`.
- Web GTM container: `GTM-5TWMJQFP`.
- First-party paths: `/__gtg` and `/__sgtm`.
- `server_container_url`: `https://utekos.no/__sgtm`.
- sGTM health and Google tag endpoints return 200.
- `/__sgtm` is `no-store` and was not a cache HIT.
- No `AW-` native Google Ads conversion tag was found in the published web payload. However, live browser smoke (2026-07-20) observed Google Ads destination `AW-18180376403` in `pagead2.googlesyndication.com/ccm/collect` pings both pre-consent (cookieless, `npa=1`) and post-consent. The destination is most plausibly wired through the `GT-MKRLF5WK` Google tag configuration rather than a GTM tag. This must be reconciled against the policy that excludes native Google Ads conversion tags (see DEV-017).

The previous IDs `GTM-WZ4R3PQL` and `GTM-PGTJ3FJ` are refuted as active identities: both fail runtime resolution and only occur in planning text. The exact server-container ID, version, tags/clients/transformations and paused states remain blocked by GTM API authorization. The block's root cause is now verified: the Stape-hosted GTM MCP (`gtm-mcp.stape.ai` via `mcp-remote`) works, but its cached OAuth identity in `~/.mcp-auth/` has zero visible GTM accounts. The GA4 MCP has the identical identity problem. Resolution requires the user to re-authenticate interactively with the Google account that owns `GTM-5TWMJQFP`.

No direct application Measurement Protocol transport exists. Browser Google collection still reaches `/g/collect` through Google tag/sGTM, which is protocol traffic owned by GTM rather than a direct application `mp/collect` adapter. The published legacy direct MP tag was previously documented as removed, but exact current server-container internals remain blocked.

### Google Data Manager

Google Data Manager server outbox exists for 24 active events. Mappings:

- require a GA client ID for active dispatch;
- use canonical event ID as transaction ID where mapped;
- cap parameter/URL lengths;
- deduplicate and cap hashed email/phone identifiers at ten;
- use restricted-country logic for IP matching;
- persist response, request ID and validation result;
- reconcile request status every five minutes.

Production configuration was observed with `GOOGLE_DATA_MANAGER_VALIDATE_ONLY`; the repository/runtime audit found validate-only enabled. Therefore current acceptance can validate payloads without proving live provider ingestion. The request-ID coverage query observed 3,501 request IDs among 6,095 Google rows. The separate provider-total query observed 6,092 Google rows. Those live queries were not one repeatable-read transaction, so the three-row difference is snapshot timing rather than a stable denominator. Rows without request IDs cannot be reconciled through the current poller.

### Meta

- Published browser destination: `1092362672918571`.
- Current source mappings: `PageView`, `ViewContent`, `AddToCart`, `AddToWishlist`, `InitiateCheckout`, `Purchase`, `Search`, `Lead`.
- Every current server mapper uses canonical `event_id`.
- Dataset-quality snapshot/retry crons exist.

Events Manager evidence was obtained 2026-07-20 through the Graph API v23.0 with the system-user token (the remote `facebook-ads` MCP entry has an empty token header and exposes no tools; direct Graph API reads replaced it):

- The dataset is live: `last_fired_time` 2026-07-19T22:51Z, and a 6-hour recheck showed SERVER 242 / BROWSER 125 events still arriving.
- The 7-day event-name distribution contains **only PascalCase provider names** (PageView 3562, ViewContent 2260, LandingScrollDepth 982, Purchase 55 and more). The PascalCase/snake_case coexistence in the warehouse is historical; it is not present in the current 7-day provider window.
- Event-source split 7d: SERVER 3959 / BROWSER 1838. Match keys: `external_id` 7461 (dominant), `email` 59, `phone` 47.
- The browser pixel is configured with **openbridge3 / Meta CAPI Gateway**: the signals config for `1092362672918571` declares gateway endpoint `https://mpc2-prod-25-is5qnl632q-wl.a.run.app/` with an AWS ECS fallback, and both hosts are explicitly allowed in the production CSP `connect-src`. Browser events therefore do not use `facebook.com/tr`. In-session wire observation of the gateway POST was not possible (the pixel binds its network primitives before instrumentation), but dataset arrival of BROWSER events proves delivery.
- The browser console shows a live data-quality warning: `[Meta Pixel] - Invalid parameter format for currency`.

Numeric EMQ per event and the alleged paused server-container CAPI Gateway tag remain blocked: EMQ scores are not exposed on the `/stats` aggregations used here, and server GTM internals require the GTM Admin re-authentication described above. The destination-mismatch hypothesis is refuted for the browser side: the published web payload, source/config and the live dataset all agree on `1092362672918571` and the dataset actively receives from both sources.

### Microsoft

- Published browser UET tag: `97247724`.
- Browser UET is present and consent-gated.
- Vercel contains the relevant credential variable names, including the UET CAPI token name; values were not read in the original audit. Local `.env.mcp.local` / `.env.local` hold ApiToken aliases for agents.
- **Purchase server worker reintroduced (2026-07-20 code):** `microsoft_uet:purchase` is registered and catalog `serverOutbox` is `active`. Fail-closed plan skips: `missing_msclkid`, `missing_capi_token`. Other Microsoft events remain `blocked_no_worker`.
- Historical Microsoft attempts remain `skipped_unqualified` until a new qualified purchase is accepted after deploy.

Microsoft UET CAPI purchase is **implemented in-repo**, not yet production-verified. Production requires Vercel ApiToken env + a consent-gated Microsoft-click purchase smoke. Live conversion goals (2026-07-20 audit): UET Active; Add To Cart, Begin Checkout, PageView Active. Browser smoke verified UET `pageLoad` + custom `view_item` post-consent.

### PostHog

PostHog remains represented in the catalog as planned/not implemented. It is not part of the active canonical dispatch registry.

## Shopify webhooks

Routes:

- `orders-paid` -> canonical `purchase`
- `refunds-create` -> canonical `refund`
- `products-create`, `products-update`, `products-delete` -> cache invalidation only

Webhook HMAC is verified fail-closed against the raw body with SHA-256 and constant-time comparison. Purchase/refund IDs are deterministic. `refunds/create` means a refund object was created; it does not prove settlement or financial reconciliation.

No webhook registration code or `shopify.app.toml` was found. On 2026-07-20 the Shopify Admin GraphQL API (2025-07) verified that the app owning `SHOPIFY_ADMIN_API_TOKEN` has **zero app-scoped webhook subscriptions** (`webhookSubscriptions(first:50)` returned empty nodes). Purchases nonetheless keep reaching the ledger (16 rows in 7d), which recent evidence attributes to the browser purchase route plus the `meta-purchase-replay` backfill script on a concurrent branch (see DEV-018). Whether any *other* app delivers `orders-paid`/`refunds-create` webhooks to these routes remains unknown; the delivery path for the webhook routes is therefore unproven, while the subscription emptiness for this app token is proven.

## Production data snapshot

| Measure | 2026-07-20 value |
|---|---:|
| Ledger events | 19,043 |
| Provider attempts | 21,588 |
| Dead-letter events | 1,127 |
| Unresolved dead letters | 0 |
| Consent snapshots | 15,046 |
| Duplicate ledger event IDs | 0 |
| Pending/processing/retry/dead-lettered attempts | 0 |

Provider attempts:

- Meta: 15,274
- Google: 6,092
- Microsoft UET: 222

Status:

- Meta: 13,291 `succeeded`, 1,773 `accepted_unverified`, 210 skipped
- Google: 4,572 `succeeded`, 1,045 `accepted_unverified`, 475 skipped
- Microsoft: 222 skipped

The prior 18,400/20,500 counts were earlier lower snapshots. The prior 1,174 dead letters exceed the current 1,127 by 47; deletion/retention/earlier counting cannot be proven from current evidence and requires audit-log reconciliation.

Historical errors:

- 635 `google_data_manager_permanent_error`, resolved
- 340 `Missing client_id`, resolved/marked attribution repair
- page-location/session payload families, resolved/classified
- historical Meta token-expiry rows

Current code converts missing Google client ID to a qualified skip and caps page-location values. No matching Google permanent-error runtime group appeared in the last seven days.

## Production logs

Both five-minute crons are active and predominantly return 200. Neither appears in seven-day Vercel error groups. Relevant project-wide errors:

- Supabase `EMAXCONNSESSION` for web-vitals and consent snapshots: indirectly relevant to warehouse write reliability.
- Next.js “Failed to parse postponed state”: not a canonical event defect, but affects high-traffic rendering routes.
- Browser extension/Cookiebot `Illegal invocation`: not reproduced in the inspected server error groups.
- Historical `UET is not defined`: not reproduced in the inspected server error groups; browser-console verification remains blocked.

## Tests and baseline validation

| Command | Exit | Result |
|---|---:|---|
| `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | 0 | Lockfile current |
| `pnpm lint` | 1 | Pre-existing repository-wide violations; 55,916 findings, including generated/vendor/skill surfaces |
| `pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` | 2 | Stale `.next/types/validator.ts` route constraints for two routes |
| `node --test $(find src -name '*.test.ts')` | 1 | Incorrect direct Node runner cannot resolve the project TS/module setup; no package `test` script exists |
| `find src -name '*.test.ts' ... pnpm exec tsx --test` | 1 | 316 tests: 313 passed; three unrelated Shopify/cache tests fail because the standalone runner imports `server-only` |
| `find src/lib/analytics src/app/api/cron ... pnpm exec tsx --test` | 0 | 265 targeted analytics/cron tests passed |
| `pnpm build` | 0 | Next.js production build, type phase and 121 static pages succeeded |
| `pnpm exec next typegen && pnpm exec tsc --noEmit` | 0 | Post-build route types regenerated; standalone typecheck passed |

The build and explicit post-build type generation demonstrate that the initial standalone typecheck failure was stale generated `.next` state rather than a documentation change. No runtime file was changed to repair baseline failures.

## Principal risks

1. A request-path event drains the entire registry and can process unrelated backlog.
2. Published/live Meta destination and server-tag state are not fully verifiable without Meta/GTM read access.
3. Historical/provider names coexist with canonical names; older rows are not uniformly claimable by current workers.
4. Generic accepted status does not express Meta and Google finality equally.
5. Google diagnostics lookups lack an aligned request-ID index; main claims lack an event-name-aligned index.
6. Data Manager is validate-only, so “accepted” is not proof of live ad-destination ingestion.
7. Microsoft UET CAPI purchase worker is in-repo; production smoke and non-purchase events remain open.
8. App-scoped Shopify webhook subscriptions/deliveries are unverified.
9. Consent snapshots stop after the 2026-07-15 reset; this is consistent with the reset but must not be described as an active snapshot writer.

## Areas blocked from verification

Updated 2026-07-20 (evening) after agent credential repair:

- **Resolved:** GTM Admin for web + server. Project `gtm-mcp` OAuth token refreshed; `list_gtm_accounts` returns both accounts. Service-account inventory also works via `scripts/mcp/run-gtm-readonly-inventory.mjs`. Server container is `GTM-M8GT97CV` (`248521914`) with `taggingServerUrls=["https://utekos.no/__sgtm"]`. Published server version 29 has only `GA4` + `Conversion Linker` tags (no Meta CAPI Gateway tag in sGTM). Evidence: `.agent-artifacts/analytics/gtm-readonly-inventory-2026-07-20.json`.
- **Resolved (EMQ):** numeric Meta EMQ via Graph `v25.0/dataset_quality`. Live 2026-07-20: PageView/ViewContent/AddToCart/InitiateCheckout **6.1**, Purchase **9.3**.
- **Meta dedupe (2026-07-20 evening — fail-closed):** Deduplication is **not proven** and Events Manager shows it is **not healthy** for ViewContent right now. Evidence:
  - Events Manager Deduplication: PageView / AddToCart / InitiateCheckout = «Still Parsing Your Data»; **ViewContent** = «Deduplication has not been set up» / improve event ID coverage (no Overlap).
  - Graph `dataset_quality`: field-table spelling `dedup_key_feedback` is invalid (`(#100) nonexisting field`); example spelling `dedupe_key_feedback` is valid but **omitted** from the live response (not `[]`). `event_coverage` also omitted. Probe: `.agent-artifacts/analytics/meta-dedupe-field-probe-2026-07-20.json`.
  - Test Events (`TEST46149`): browser ViewContent and a manual CAPI ViewContent arrived as **separate** events with different `event_id`s and products — that only proves both channels reach Meta, **not** shared-ID dedupe. A script + unrelated UI hit never shares an ID; production dedupe requires one app-minted UUID on Pixel `eventID` and CAPI `event_id` for the same action.
  - Do not claim browser/server Meta dedupe OK until Events Manager shows Overlap for `event_id` (or Dataset Quality returns non-omitted `dedupe_key_feedback`) on ViewContent and the parsing events. Collector stores omitted feedback as `{ status: 'omitted_by_provider' }` instead of coercing to `[]`.
- **Resolved:** Microsoft live conversion goals + UET tag via `npm run microsoft-ads:audit` after Entra OAuth refresh (keep `.env.mcp.local` Microsoft tokens preferred over stale `.env.local`). UET `97247724` Active; goals: Add To Cart, Begin Checkout, PageView Active; Utgående klikk Paused. Purchase product goal not visible in Campaign Management v13 type set.
- **Microsoft UET CAPI purchase (2026-07-20 code + deploy):** `microsoft_uet:purchase` worker + catalog `active` outbox reintroduced and production-deployed as `dpl_3Pe1KmJSj5unFh1jD7VytiPvFr5H` (`490f33126`) on `utekos.no`. Gateway smoke green; UET CAPI ApiToken auth probe green (400 ValidationError with valid token, 401 without). Full purchase-journey CAPI proof still awaits the next real Microsoft-attributed purchase (no synthetic payment). Non-purchase Microsoft events remain `blocked_no_worker`.
- **Resolved earlier:** Meta Events Manager activity/source split/match keys; Shopify app-scoped subscriptions empty; browser console/network smoke SMOKE-001..007.
- **Partially resolved:** Google Ads destination `AW-18180376403` observed in browser smoke; per-request Data Manager diagnostics beyond stored application responses remain limited.
